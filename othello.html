            <p>The game Othello, also known as Reversi, is a board game where two players try to get as many as their pieces in the board. One player plays the black pieces and another the white ones. Taking turns, a player puts a one of his pieces in the board, trying to flip the other player's pieces into his own.</p>

            <p>I coded the game in python, implementing Artificial Intelligence through a Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.</p>
